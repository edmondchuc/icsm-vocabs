We use data modelling, data governance and data systems implementation expertise all based on Semantic Web and Knowledge Graph principles to ensure data is in the richest, most open and most extensible form it can be.

We use knowledge graphs for data storage, as a transfer format, when serialised, and as inputs to advanced reasoning and data processing tasks, such as for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence applications.""" ;

<https://w3id.org/profile/vocpub>
    schema:description """This is a profile of the taxonomy data model SKOS - i.e. SKOS with additional constraints. It defines some compulsory properties for SKOS's ConceptScheme, Concept and Collection classes and ensures that certain relationships between them are present, e.g. topConceptOf & inScheme linking Concepts to ConceptSchemes. It also requires goes a bit beyond 'pure' SKOS by ensuring that Concepts indicate the ConceptScheme they are defined in, which may be different to the ConceptScheme they re presented in. This allows VocPub-valid SKOS Concepts to be re-used in multiple of vocabularies efficiently.

    This profile is used for multiple Australian government and international vocabularies and is entirely generic, i.e. the additional constraints are not Australian or government-specific but just ensure certain technical model capabilities in the data.""" ;

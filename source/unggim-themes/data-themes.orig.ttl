unggim-dt:GCRF
	a skos:Concept ;
	skos:broader	unggim-dt:DataTheme ;
	skos:note "The Global Geodetic Reference Frame is the framework which allows users to precisely determine and express locations on the Earth, as well as to quantify changes of the Earth in space and time. It is not a data theme in the sense of the other themes, but it is a prerequisite for the accurate collection, integration, and use of all other geospatial data." ;
	skos:prefLabel	"Global Geodetic Reference Frame"@en .

unggim-dt:Addresses
	a	skos:Concept ;
	skos:broader	unggim-dt:DataTheme ;
	skos:note "An Address is a structured label, usually containing a property number, a street name and a locality name. It’s used to identify a plot of land, a building or part of a building, or some other construction, together with coordinates indicating their geographic position. Addresses are often used as a proxy for other data themes such as Land Parcels." ;
	skos:prefLabel	"Addresses"@en .

unggim-dt:Buildings-Settlements
	a	skos:Concept ;
	skos:broader	unggim-dt:DataTheme ;
		skos:note "A Building refers to any roofed structure permanently constructed or erected on its site, for the protection of humans, animals, things, or the production of economic goods. Settlements are collections of buildings and associated features where a community carries out socio-economic activities." ;
	skos:prefLabel	"Buildings and Settlements"@en .

unggim-dt:Elevation-Depth
	a	skos:Concept ;
	skos:broader	unggim-dt:DataTheme ;
	skos:note "The Elevation and Depth theme describes the surface of the Earth both on land and under a body of water, relative to a vertical datum." ;
	skos:prefLabel	"Elevation and Depth"@en .

unggim-dt:FunctionalAreas
	a	skos:Concept ;
	skos:broader	unggim-dt:DataTheme ;
	skos:note "Functional Areas are the geographical extent of administrative, legislative, regulatory, electoral, statistical, governance, service delivery and activity management areas." ;
	skos:prefLabel	"Functional Areas"@en .

unggim-dt:GeographicalNames
	a	skos:Concept ;
	skos:broader	unggim-dt:DataTheme ;
	skos:note "Geographical Names provide orientation and identity to places. They are location identifiers for cultural and physical features of the real world, such as regions, settlements, or any feature of public or historical interest. They are often used as a proxy for other data themes such as Buildings and Settlements." ;
	skos:prefLabel	"Geographical Names"@en .

unggim-dt:Geology-Soils
	a	skos:Concept ;
	skos:broader	unggim-dt:DataTheme ;
	skos:note "Geology is the composition and properties of geologic materials (rocks and sediments) underground and outcropping at the Earth’s surface. It includes bedrock, aquifers, geomorphology for land and marine environments, mineral resources and overlying soils. Soils are the upper part of the Earth’s crust, formed by mineral particles, organic matter, water, air, and living organisms." ;
	skos:prefLabel	"Geology and Soils"@en .

unggim-dt:LandCover-LandUse
	a	skos:Concept ;
	skos:broader	unggim-dt:DataTheme ;
	skos:note "Land Cover represent the physical and biological cover of the Earth’s surface. Land Use is the current and future planned management, and modification of the natural environment for different human purposes or economic activities." ;
	skos:prefLabel	"Land Cover and Land Use"@en .


unggim-dt:LandParcels
	a	skos:Concept ;
	skos:broader	unggim-dt:DataTheme ;
	skos:note "Land Parcels are areas of land or more generally of the Earth’s surface (land and/or water) under common rights (such as ownership or easements), claims (such as minerals or indigenous land) or use. This theme can include individual fields and cadastral parcels." ;
	skos:prefLabel	"Land Parcels"@en .

unggim-dt:Orthoimagery
	a	skos:Concept ;
	skos:broader	unggim-dt:DataTheme ;
	skos:note "Orthoimagery is geo-referenced rectified image data of the Earth's surface, from satellite or airborne sensors. Although technically not a theme in its own right, Orthoimagery is included as, when interpreted, it’s a widely-used data source for many other data themes." ;
	skos:prefLabel	"Orthoimagery"@en .


unggim-dt:PhysicalInfrastructure
	a	skos:Concept ;
	skos:broader	unggim-dt:DataTheme ;
	skos:note "The Physical Infrastructure theme includes industrial & utility facilities, and the service delivery facilities associated with administrative & social governmental services such as public administrations, utilities, transport, civil protection, schools and hospitals." ;
	skos:prefLabel	"Physical Infrastructure"@en .


unggim-dt:PopulationDistribution
	a	skos:Concept ;
	skos:broader	unggim-dt:DataTheme ;
